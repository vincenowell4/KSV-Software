# Deploy DB and Application to Azure


## Title

*As a user I want to go to the Voting App web site and see in the address bar that the application ends with azurewebsites.net, meaning it is deployed in the Azure cloud.*

## Description

This user story is about deploying both the database and the Voting App web application to Azure. Once deployed, a user can navigate to the web application using a URL which will end with azurewebsites.net, and that will indicate to a user that the web application has been deployed to Azure. 

### Details:

1. Browser address bar for the web application ends with azurewebsites.net
